Project snapshot
This repository contains a complete business intelligence solution built for a global hardware company. The solution sits on a Tabular model in Power BI Desktop. It uses a Galaxy Schema to model complex relationships across multiple business domains. The report provides five interactive pages. Each page targets a core stakeholder group: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executives.

Key highlights
- Galaxy Schema data model with shared lookup dimensions and separate fact groups.
- Advanced DAX measures for allocation, time intelligence, and multi-currency finance.
- Power Query ETL patterns to keep data clean and performant.
- Five report pages with role-focused KPIs, drill paths, and bookmarks.
- Deployable PBIX and dataset with clear release packages. Download and execute the release asset from the releases page: https://github.com/hola22311/Business-Insights/releases

Architecture and data model (Galaxy Schema) üß≠
This solution uses a Galaxy Schema. The Galaxy Schema groups several star schemas that share dimension tables. It fits organizations that have multiple fact tables which need shared dimensions like Date, Product, and Location.

High-level diagram
![Galaxy Schema Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/PowerBI-visuals/master/docs/images/Architecture.png)

Core entities
- Dimensions (shared)
  - DimDate ‚Äî full date calendar with fiscal flags, week/month/quarter keys.
  - DimProduct ‚Äî product master with hierarchy (SKU, Model, Family, Category).
  - DimLocation ‚Äî geography map with plant, region, country, and DC.
  - DimCustomer ‚Äî customer master with account type, channel, and tier.
  - DimVendor ‚Äî vendor master for supply chain analytics.
  - DimCurrency ‚Äî currency codes and conversion rates.
  - DimEmployee ‚Äî simple sales owner and finance approver table.
- Fact groups
  - FactSales ‚Äî invoice-level sales with line items, price, cost, discounts.
  - FactPurchases ‚Äî purchase orders and receipts for supplier analytics.
  - FactInventory ‚Äî stock snapshots and movements.
  - FactFinancials ‚Äî GL-level balances and journal entries for finance reconciliation.
  - FactMarketing ‚Äî campaign spends, leads, and conversions.

Relationships
- Shared dimensions connect to multiple fact tables via key fields.
- Bridge tables handle many-to-many relationships where required (for example, product bundles and multi-SKU promotions).
- Role-playing Date tables allow independent time analysis for sales date, invoice date, ship date, receipt date, and GL posting date.
- Use surrogate keys for all joins to avoid NULL alignment issues.

Modeling rules used
- Keep facts narrow and tall. Avoid wide tables with sparse columns.
- Separate transactional facts (FactSales) from periodic snapshot facts (FactInventory).
- Use conformed dimensions across facts to support cross-fact joins and measures.
- Apply grain enforcement: each fact has a well-defined grain and a unique key.
- Add low-cardinality columns to dimension tables to support slicers and filter panes.

Data quality and design notes
- Normalize master data for product and location to avoid duplicate rows.
- Use natural keys for traceability but join with surrogate keys for performance.
- Flag slow-changing attributes and create type-2 history for attributes that change over time when the business needs see historical context.
- Add soft deletes or active flags rather than purging rows for auditability.

ETL / Power Query patterns üîÅ
Power Query drives the ETL layer inside the PBIX and for any external dataset refresh pipelines. The solution uses a layered ETL approach: source extract ‚Üí staging transforms ‚Üí conformed entities ‚Üí modeled dataset.

Common ETL steps
- Source extraction
  - Use native connectors where possible (SQL Server, Oracle, SAP, flat files, REST APIs).
  - Capture extract metadata: timestamp, row count, source checksum.
- Staging transformations
  - Rename columns to standard names.
  - Trim and cleanse strings.
  - Cast data types explicitly.
  - Replace sentinel values (e.g., 'N/A', 'NULL') with real nulls.
  - Use query folding when possible to push transforms to the source.
- Conformed entities
  - Merge duplicate masters using fuzzy matching where needed.
  - Deduplicate facts by using last update timestamp.
  - Generate surrogate keys using index columns.
  - Create Date table with fiscal weeks and rolling flags.
- Load and optimize
  - Reduce column count before loading into the model.
  - Convert binary or JSON into scalar columns where possible.
  - Keep calculated columns to a minimum; prefer measures.

Power Query tips
- Preserve query folding: apply filter and projection steps early.
- Use Table.Buffer sparingly and only when necessary to break folding.
- Use function queries for repeated logic (for example, standardize phone format or parse product codes).
- Build incremental refresh policies for large fact tables to limit refresh time and cost.

Sample M pattern (pseudo)
let
  Source = Sql.Database("dbserver", "db"),
  Sales = Source{[Schema="dbo", Item="InvoiceLines"]}[Data],
  Renamed = Table.RenameColumns(Sales, {{"InvDate", "InvoiceDate"}, {"SKU", "ProductKey"}}),
  Cleaned = Table.TransformColumns(Renamed, {{"Price", each Number.Round(_, 2)}}),
  Filtered = Table.SelectRows(Cleaned, each [IsVoid] = false),
  AddedKey = Table.AddIndexColumn(Filtered, "SurrogateKey", 1, 1, Int64.Type)
in
  AddedKey

Advanced DAX library üßÆ
This solution packs a DAX library to address finance-level aggregation, time-based comparatives, allocation, and advanced segmentation.

DAX patterns included
- Time intelligence
  - Custom YearToDate, QuarterToDate, MonthToDate that respect fiscal calendars.
  - Parallel period comparators for YoY and QoQ with fiscal support.
- Currency conversion
  - Dynamic currency conversion using DimCurrency rates with daily rate lookup.
  - Measures that allow users to switch report currency via a slicer.
- Allocation and proportional measures
  - Cost allocation across departments based on driver tables (e.g., headcount, area).
  - Weighted average cost across SKU families.
- Inventory metrics
  - Days of Supply: uses lead time and average daily consumption.
  - Stock out rate: measures periods below safety stock.
- Sales analytics
  - Net revenue, gross margin, and channel profitability measures.
  - Churn and cohort analysis measures for customer retention.
- Custom rolling aggregates
  - Rolling 12 months and variable window metrics using DATESINPERIOD and custom filters.
- Performance-safe measures
  - Use SUMX over filtered tables only when necessary.
  - Replace EARLIER patterns with variables and iterators.

Sample measures
Total Revenue =
SUM(FactSales[NetAmount])

Revenue YTD (Fiscal) =
VAR _fiscalYearStart = MAX(DimDate[FiscalYearStart])
RETURN
CALCULATE([Total Revenue], DATESBETWEEN(DimDate[Date], _fiscalYearStart, MAX(DimDate[Date])))

Currency Converted Sales =
VAR _rate = LOOKUPVALUE(DimCurrency[Rate], DimCurrency[Date], MAX(DimDate[Date]), DimCurrency[CurrencyCode], SELECTEDVALUE(SlicerCurrency[CurrencyCode]))
RETURN
[Total Revenue] * _rate

Allocation to Departments =
VAR TotalDriver = SUM(DriverTable[DriverValue])
VAR DeptDriver = SUMX(FILTER(DriverTable, DriverTable[Department] = SELECTEDVALUE(Department[Department])), DriverTable[DriverValue])
RETURN
IF(TotalDriver = 0, BLANK(), DeptDriver / TotalDriver * [Total Cost])

Design principles for DAX
- Use variables to break down complex logic and to reduce repeated evaluation.
- Favor measure branching: build base measures and derive complex ones from them.
- Avoid iterator-heavy patterns on large tables; use summarization tables where needed.
- Test measures with DAX Studio and PROFILE functions for heavy scans.
